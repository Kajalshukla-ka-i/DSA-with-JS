                1) . data structure ?
                    Way to organize data so that we can used data efficiently
                    eg: 
                    like in user management (users data), ecommerce (product data)

                            [8,2,1,6,0,5,7,3,4]
                
                            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


            2) Algorithm?
                    Steps and Procees to arrange data.
                            [8,2,1,6,0,5,7,3,4]
                
                            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

            3) data structure type

                    Primitive Data structure -> Integer, Float, Character, Pointer
                    Non Primitive Data structure -> Array, List, Files
                                                            |
                                                    ================                                        ________________      
                                                    |               |
                                                Linear List     Non Linear List
                                                    |                  |
                                                =========           ======== 
                                                |       |           |       |
                                            Stacks    Queues       Graps   Trees

            4)  operations of Data structure
                    -> Traversal  
                    -> Insertion
                    -> Deletion
                    -> Searching
                    -> Sorting
                    -> Merging

                    Diff. Algo can br used for options


            key Points : 
                Array 
                Stack
                Queues
                Trees
                Graph
                Insertion
                Recursion
                Search
                Sorting
                Merge
                Map
                Set

            Array Traversing and Accessing :

                one by one access all the element
                
            it can be handle with loops
