                1) . data structure ?
                    Way to organize data so that we can used data efficiently
                    eg: 
                    like in user management (users data), ecommerce (product data)

                            [8,2,1,6,0,5,7,3,4]
                
                            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


            2) Algorithm?
                    Steps and Procees to arrange data.
                            [8,2,1,6,0,5,7,3,4]
                
                            [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

            3) data structure type

                    Primitive Data structure -> Integer, Float, Character, Pointer
                    Non Primitive Data structure -> Array, List, Files
                                                            |
                                                    ================                                        ________________      
                                                    |               |
                                                Linear List     Non Linear List
                                                    |                  |
                                                =========           ======== 
                                                |       |           |       |
                                            Stacks    Queues       Graps   Trees

            4)  operations of Data structure
                    -> Traversal  
                    -> Insertion
                    -> Deletion
                    -> Searching
                    -> Sorting
                    -> Merging

                    Diff. Algo can br used for options


            key Points : 
                Array 
                Stack
                Queues
                Trees
                Graph
                Insertion
                Recursion
                Search
                Sorting
                Merge
                Map
                Set

            Array Traversing and Accessing :

                one by one access all the element
                
            it can be handle with loops
        Linear Search : it check element one by one

        Algorithm complexity : 

        Space complexity:  
            refers to the amount of memory an algorithm or program uses to complete its execution. It measures the total amount of memory required by an algorithm, including both fixed and variable components.
            
            OR

            space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
            space complexity = Auxiliary space + input size

        Time complexity : 
            The time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution

                                        Algorithm  complexity
                                                  |
                                        ====================          
                                        |                  |
                                    Time complexity    Space complexity

        Big O notation Use to denote complexity(both)

        Asymptotic Analysis and notation :

        * f(n) = 5(n)2 + 6n+12
        
        Recursion :  Recursion is a powerful technique in computer science where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
