<h4>What is DSA?</h4>

DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics â€“ Data Structure and Algorithms.

<h4>DSA Full Form</h4>
The term DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms.

<h4>Types of Data Structure</h4>
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

1) Linear data structure
2) Non-linear data structure

<h4>What is an Algorithm?</h4>

algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output.

<h4>Stack In  Data Structure</h4>
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

For Example : 

You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.

Here, you can:

Put a new plate on top
Remove the top plate
And, if you want the plate at the bottom, you must first remove all the plates on top. This is exactly how the stack data structure works.

<h4>LIFO Principle of Stack</h4>
Putting an item on top of the stack is called push and removing an item is called pop.
