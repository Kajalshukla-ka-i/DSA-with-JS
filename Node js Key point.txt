What is Node js ?

    This is not an programming language but Node js internally used javascript to run its code.
    This is a server enviroment it have extra feature than javascript like databse connection , APIs Integration,File System.

    But bith are not exactly same
    In javascript  we cannot to DB but Node we can
    Node js run on server side and javascript run on browser

Client and Server sides

                    Request
Client    ---------------------------->     Server
   |       <--------------------------        |
   |               Response                   |
   |                                        Node Js
Javascript,
HTML
CSS

Where do we used Node js 
    We used node js on server side because it connect with database and file system and all and javascript used Client

How node js used javascript 
     
         chrome                                                                 Node js
         | |                                                                      |  |   
results  | | Javascript code                                 Javascript code      |  |  results
         | |                                                                      |  |
        =================================================================================
                                         Writte in c++

    In actually chrome browser we have V8 engine that can execute javascript code and in the sam eway node is basicallypresent on the server side but node js also have the this V8 engine. So that we can write any code it execute this javascript code and then on that way node js basically used the javascript. and its on serverside that by it connect with database and file system also.

=========================================================

What developer Make with Node js
    developers Make API with Node js
    so we can connect server with Client
    Node can make API for web, Android and IOS etc.
    Make can also make website

==================================================

What developer Make  with Node js?

    Web App , Mobile App,<-> (server) <-> File server , database

================================================

Why used npm 
    The version of npm and node will different.
    It is a node Package manager . it is helping tool.
    when we Install node js npm is automatically installed. It is different from node.
    The full Forms of npm is Node Package manager so when we to installed extra Package or external liberay  in our project.
